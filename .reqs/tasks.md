## Architecture Considerations

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask App Factory Pattern**: Cleanly separates application configuration and initialization
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated into service classes (TwitterService, OpenAIService, TrendService)
- **Repository Pattern**: Database operations abstracted through SQLAlchemy models
- **Background Tasks**: Celery-ready task structure for scheduled operations

### Database Design
- **Normalized Schema**: Proper relationships between entities with foreign key constraints
- **Vector Storage**: PGVector extension for AI embeddings and similarity search
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized indexes for frequent queries (full-text search, date ranges)
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of old data to prevent database bloat

### Frontend Architecture
- **Progressive Enhancement**: HTMX provides dynamic functionality while maintaining accessibility
- **Component-Based CSS**: Modular stylesheets for maintainability
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap Material UI
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, debounced search, optimized asset delivery

### AI/ML Integration
- **Vector Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings for semantic similarity
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines full-text search with vector similarity
- **Clustering**: K-means clustering for trend identification
- **Content Generation**: GPT-4o for trend descriptions and blog content

### Security & Performance
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout
- **XSS Protection**: Template escaping and content sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting and request throttling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
