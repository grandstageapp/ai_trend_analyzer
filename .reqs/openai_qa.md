# OpenAI Trend Service QA & Optimization Plan

## Overview
Fix trend service timeout and reliability issues to ensure complete end-to-end data processing pipeline functionality.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Add Timeout Protection ‚è≥
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Add timeout configuration to OpenAI service
  - Configure API call timeouts (30s for embeddings, 60s for chat)
  - Add timeout handling in openai_service.py
  - Test timeout behavior with mock slow responses

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Add retry decorator for API calls
  - Implement exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
  - Maximum 3 retry attempts per API call

- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Add circuit breaker pattern for API failures
  - Track API failure rates
  - Temporarily disable API calls if failure rate > 50%
  - Auto-recovery after cooldown period

### Phase 2: Optimize API Usage üöÄ
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Batch similar API calls where possible
  - Group trend description generation calls
  - Process multiple trends in single API call when feasible
  - Reduce total API call count by 40-60%

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Add request caching to avoid duplicate calls
  - Cache embedding results for identical content
  - Cache trend descriptions for similar post clusters
  - Implement TTL-based cache expiration

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Simplify prompts to reduce processing time
  - Optimize trend identification prompts
  - Reduce token count in API requests
  - Streamline response format requirements

### Phase 3: Graceful Degradation üõ°Ô∏è
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Create trends even if description generation fails
  - Allow trend creation with basic title only
  - Continue processing other trends if one fails
  - Track which trends need description retry

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Use basic descriptions as fallback
  - Generate simple descriptions from post content
  - Use template-based descriptions when AI fails
  - Ensure trends are never created without any description

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Log failures but don't block the entire process
  - Add comprehensive error logging
  - Continue trend analysis even with partial failures
  - Generate summary reports of API issues

### Phase 4: Performance Monitoring üìä
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Add execution time tracking
  - Track time for each trend analysis step
  - Monitor total pipeline execution time
  - Log performance metrics to database

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Monitor API call success rates
  - Track OpenAI API success/failure rates
  - Monitor rate limit usage
  - Alert when success rate drops below 80%

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Alert on consistently failing operations
  - Set up alerting for repeated failures
  - Monitor system health after trend analysis
  - Generate daily performance reports

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete trend analysis pipeline runs without timeouts
- [ ] API failures don't block entire process
- [ ] Trend analysis completes in under 120 seconds
- [ ] 95%+ success rate for end-to-end trend processing
- [ ] Real Twitter data successfully processed into trends

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test with real Twitter data (15 existing posts)
- [ ] Simulate API timeout scenarios
- [ ] Test with varying cluster sizes (2-10 posts)
- [ ] Verify graceful degradation under API failures
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline test with monitoring

## Dependencies
- OpenAI API (embeddings + chat completions)
- Twitter data collection (already working)
- Database operations (already working)
- Existing trend scoring system (already working)
