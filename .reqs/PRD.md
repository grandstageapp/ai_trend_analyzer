# Product Requirements Document - AI Trends Analyzer

*Note: The Product Requirements Document is provided to the LLM to guide development as a PRD.md file.*

**Context:** This document is a product requirements document (PRD) for an AI-powered social media trends analysis tool, enabling users to find trending topics on AI within X posts. This document will be a guide for you on the requirements for building this application. Before beginning to build or enhance any feature, review this document again in full for context to what needs to be built and why.

Under the "Product Requirements" heading you will find the requirements enumerated 1., 1.1, 1.2.1, and so on. This is to express the sequencing in which features should be built. 

Create a markdown file titled "tasks.md" within the .reqs directory with a task list of all of the features that need to be built. The task list should be a table with the following columns: Task Name, Requirements, Task Status (Not Started, In Progress, or Completed), Considerations (containing technical architecture considerations), and Notes (updates on what was completed). Before beginning work on any item in that task list, fill in the architectural considerations first and use that as a guide for your work. After you start and complete each task, update the status and notes column with details of what was built.

**Role:** You are an expert AI Engineer for one of the hottest new B2B CRM companies. You were educated at UC Berkeley, graduated top of our class in Engineering, and were recruited into this role in your final semester after winning a coveted hackathon. You've done internships at both Meta and Open AI. You have been building applications in Python since high school, and already have a reputation throughout the Valley for being one of the best engineers on the market.

**Situation:** You are working with an in-house Media department within the B2B SaaS CRM company. This team creates non-branded email newsletters, blogs, and social media content about topics of interest to CRM customers. Your job is to AI-powered tools to enable higher quality and efficiency in content creation. 

**Goal:** Increase brand association between the CRM company and AI topics to increase .

**Problem:** The Media department pod responsible for creating AI content lack technical proficiency in AI, and need a tool that can help them find trending topics, and understand and produce content about them.

**Solution:** Build an AI-powered app that synthesizes trends from the top AI-focused posts, distills that information into data visualizations of trending topics, and provides a simple explanation of each topic to help content creators get up to speed with minimal research. 

**User Persona:** Sarah Kim, 28, is the content producer for a B2B CEM company. She studied English at Boston College, and is an esteemed writer and photo journalist. She's moderately tech-savvy, not an engineer, and mainly uses digital tools in her work. She is technical enough to understand high-level technical concepts, but not architect and build a software application.  

## Technical Requirements

- Build the application backend and API's in Flask.
  - Use an App Factory pattern for building this application.

- Use HTMX as the frontend framework. 

- Use Bootstrap Material UI as the design system.

- Use Chart.js to generate data visualizations.

- Make the user experience amazing, adding animations and dynamic interactions when possible.

- Use Postgres as the database. 

- Use PGVector as our vector data store.
  - Configure PGVector to use hybrid Postgres full text search and cosine similarity for vector search.

- Use Langchain and related libraries for integration with Open AI's API.

- Use Open AI's embeddings model to generate vector embeddings. 

- Use the Twitter/X API to find trending social media topics. 

- Avoid any of the following mistakes when writing code:
  - Incorporate error logging and debugging in every feature.
  - Generate automated tests at the end of each product requirement. Run those tests to ensure the feature works correctly.
  - Do not write inline CSS or JS. Always place CSS and JS within the appropriate /static/css or /static/js files.
  - Avoid hardcoding any variables or constants that are likely to change. Store these values as environment variables or in a configuration file.
  - Do not write any database operations without proper error handling.
  - Do not use placeholder or mock data in the final application. Ensure all data comes from actual API calls or user input.
